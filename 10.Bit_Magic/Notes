So today I learnt about bit magic.
Big Magic consists of six operators.
The operators are 
bitwise and   --&
bitwise or      --||
bitwise xor    -- ^
Right shift operator  >> 
left shift operator   <<
and bitwise not   ~

1<<x --> 2 power x
1<<(x-1) --> 2 power x-1
log2(any number) - returns the number of times that number can be expressed as power of 2.

Right Most Bit Masking  = (x&x``) 
x`` = 2s complement = -x

1.Check if the kth bit is set or not
2.First Set BIt
3.Difference in a bit of two numbers
4.Counting of set bits in 1-N natural numbers
